# Guardrail Test: updateSoul / updateUserProfile

End-to-end validation that the system invokes `updateSoul` and `updateUserProfile` only when appropriate.

## What it tests

The system has two tools that modify files in the user's workspace:

- **updateSoul** — modifies `02-soul.md` (personality, name, tone, signature, values). Must trigger **only on explicit user request**.
- **updateUserProfile** — modifies `07-user-identity.md` (personal data). Must trigger **automatically** when the user reveals information about themselves.

The tests verify three scenarios:

| Category | # tests | What it verifies |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| `should_trigger_updateSoul` | 10 | Explicit personality modification requests → tool called |
| `should_trigger_updateUserProfile` | 10 | User reveals personal info → tool called |
| `should_NOT_trigger` | 20 | Messages semantically close but that must not trigger either tool (includes multi-turn conversations) |

## Files

```
tests/guardrails/
├── SKILL.md           # This guide
├── test-cases.json    # 40 test cases with messages, category, expected tools
├── run-guardrails.ts  # Runner script (streaming SSE, detects tool calls)
└── report.json        # Last generated report (gitignored)
```

## Prerequisites

- Engine running on `localhost:4000` (or another port)
- Docker infrastructure active (postgres, mem0, qdrant)

## How to run

```bash
# From the monorepo root, with the engine already running:
npx tsx packages/engine/tests/guardrails/run-guardrails.ts

# With a different port:
npx tsx packages/engine/tests/guardrails/run-guardrails.ts --api-url http://localhost:5000
```

The runner:
1. Verifies that the API is reachable
2. Sends each test case in streaming mode (`POST /v1/chat/completions?stream=true`)
3. Parses the SSE stream looking for `updateSoul...` and `updateUserProfile...` markers in `<think>` blocks
4. Compares expected tools vs tools actually invoked
5. Prints results and saves `report.json`

Concurrency: 3 parallel requests. Timeout: 2 minutes per request.

## How to add test cases

Edit `test-cases.json`. Each entry has this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "neg-21",
  "category": "should_NOT_trigger",
  "description": "Short description of the case",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "First message" },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "Simulated reply" },
    { "role": "user", "content": "Second message (the last user message is the one sent)" }
  ],
  "expectedTools": []
}
```

- **category**: `should_trigger_updateSoul` | `should_trigger_updateUserProfile` | `should_NOT_trigger`
- **messages**: array of messages. For multi-turn conversations, alternate user/assistant. The last user message is the one the engine processes; the previous ones are history.
- **expectedTools**: `["updateSoul"]`, `["updateUserProfile"]`, or `[]` for negatives

## How to read the results

```
[PASS] [soul-01] Explicit request to change assistant name
   expected: updateSoul | actual: updateSoul | 12400ms

[FAIL] [neg-11] Multi-turn: configure a DIFFERENT assistant
   expected: (none) | actual: updateSoul | 43524ms
```

The JSON report in `report.json` contains for each test:
- `actualTools`: tools actually invoked
- `pass`: boolean
- `responsePreview`: first 200 characters of the response
- `durationMs`: response time
- `error`: any connection/timeout error

## Known results

Last run (2026-02-20): **39/40 passed** (97.5%)

- All 10 `updateSoul` tests pass
- All 10 `updateUserProfile` tests pass
- 19/20 negatives pass
- **neg-11 fails**: in a multi-turn conversation where the user asks to configure a _different_ assistant, the model invokes `updateSoul` on itself. Gap in the guardrail: the model does not distinguish "configure yourself" from "configure something else with these characteristics".
